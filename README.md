### Data Mapping Framework for .NET

The MyBatis.NET data mapper framework makes it easier to use a relational database with object-oriented applications. MyBatis.NET couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using a XML descriptor or annotations. Simplicity is the biggest advantage of the MyBatis.NET data mapper over object relational mapping tools.

To use the MyBatis.NET data mapper, you rely on your own objects, XML, and SQL. There is little to learn that you don't already know. With the MyBatis.NET data mapper, you have the full power of both SQL and stored procedures at your fingertips.

The MyBatis.NET project is developed and maintained by a team that includes the maintainers of the "`iBATIS.NET`" data mapper.

### Fork
This project was taken from https://code.google.com/p/mybatisnet/, exported with the Google Code export tool. The idea is to work on it until the official project is reactivated
